While there, I developed front-end and backend features in Swift. </p>\n  \t\t<p>I worked with different teams, including UX designers, and had a chance to watch them work: conducting research, discovering problems and designing solutions while keeping the end-user in mind, crafting experiences for our users, creating wireframes and prototypes - all that really excited me. Moreover, I enjoyed working on the user-side of the application the most and I was always thinking about what I could do to make the app more user-friendly in both functionality and aesthetics.</p>\n  \t\t<p>As a UX designer I will continue to help people connect deeper and derive more value from their digital experiences. Applying human psychology to the design of digital experiences is fascinating and highly rewarding.</p>\n  \t</div>\n  \t<div className=\"resume-button\">\n  \t\t<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jPRRwZ26pUx6iXv1McWdjOMVnY5F4V5/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">\n  \t\t\tView My Resume\n  \t\t</a>\n  \t</div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/profile-c74e31bfff88307bf53e1f8b14db87ae.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
